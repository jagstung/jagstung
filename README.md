## ðŸ‘‹ Hello world! I'm Jagraj, an aspiring DevOps Engineer on a mission to bridge the gap between development and operations. Having honed my skills during a year-long internship as a Cloud Engineer, I'm now diving into personal projects to deepen my understanding and gain hands-on experience in the dynamic realm of DevOps.

## ðŸš€ Currently, my focus lies on projects utilising Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS, Docker, and Git. Each repository here serves as a snapshot of my journey into the intricacies of infrastructure as code, containerization, and cloud services. It's not about quantity but quality, and every project reflects a deliberate step towards mastering the tools that define modern software development.

## ðŸ’» Join me on this exciting adventure! Explore my projects, provide feedback, or collaborate on the ever-evolving landscape of DevOps. Let's build, automate, and deploy together!
